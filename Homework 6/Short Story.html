        <h2>A Snippet of A Future Fanfic Chapter In The Works</h2>

        <p>Today should've been like any other day. A day filled with hunting down hunts for gil, traveling between Galdin Quay and Hammerhead, and the like. A happy day of hunting with friends, bonding over a 'simple' mission of protect the crowned prince on his journey across the world to learn about his future Kingdom. Life had been peaceful since King Noctis had been crowned king all those years ago after the original war against Niflheim, a time of growth and prosperity following shortly after. In the beginning, it may have originally been an uncertain future, but it was a future for the generations that followed.</p>

        <p>Instead, the stormy weather mimics the atmosphere in the caravan quite perfectly. There's a heavy, forboding aura in the room. The ones that bleed into your skin, seeping into your bones. Everyone was unusually quiet, trying to come to terms with the news they had just heard. Dahlia took note of everyone's stiff postures. Nyxis Lucis Caelum, the crowned prince, sat cross-legged on a bed, hunched over, face buried in his hands. Antonion Amicita and Cypress Argentum sat at the dining table, nervously fidgeting in their seats, their concern written plainly across their faces. Out of al of them, Dahlia had remained calm and collected, keeping her worries hidden from the rest. Something she had inherited from her father, Ignis Scientia.</p>
        
        <p>Still, it hurts knowing that the city you had grown up in had fallen. It hurts even more not knowing if your family, or anyone in your family, had survived the attack. No one has been able to contact anyone in the city. Cell connection had only been met with static or an immediate disconnect, possibly due to some sort of interference with the cell towers. Everyone had felt uneasy, anxious about not being able to contact any of their parents, instilling a sense of guilt in not being able to protect any of them due to everyone being out of town. Everyone hope that one of them would at least call one of them with an update, considering the fact that a direct attack on King Noctis and his Crownsguard had been made.</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly, frantic knicking on the door drew the attention of everyone in the room. They shared knowing looks, lightly touching their weapons at hearing the frantic sounds from the other side of the door. Dahlia approached the door cautiously, peering through the peephole suspiciously. She let out a sigh, noticing the familiar red and yellow of Cindy. She opened the door wide, framing a sad and disheveld Cindy in the door frame.</p>
        
        <p>"We've got something for y'all to see. It's urgent," Cindy spoke shakily, gesturing for them to follow. Sharing a look, everyone gathered their stuff, before following Cindy outside to the garage.</p>
        
        <p>The moment they stepped outside, eyes adjusting to the light, their faces paled at the sight of the Regalia sitting by the garage looking like it was in desperate need of repairs. They approached the car quickly. It was when they had gotten closer did they notice the scratches, dents and the blood stains littered across the entirety of the car. They stopped and stood next to the car, their bodies shaking in fear and shock. How did the Regalia escape Insomnia?</p>
        
        <p>"Dahlia?" a voice rang, followed by a fit of whet coughing.</p>

        <p>Dahlia's head whipped around to look where the voice had come from. Her eyes widened, letting out a rare show of emotion. The sight of her father, Ignis Scientia, propped up against a wall, injured, caused a sense of fear to flood her. She rushed over to him, kneeling next to him and gently grapping hold of his outstretched gloved hand, ignoring the calls of the others. He was bloodied and bruised, fresh cuts still bleeding. His other arm rested across his abdomen, clutching it tightly in pain. She knew it was him by the scar by his left eye, and the milky whites of his blind eyes.</p>
        
        <p>"Daddy, I'm here," she whispered into his ear after she had leaned in close to him, tears streaming down her face. She leaned her forehead against the side of his face, letting him know just how close she was to him, attempting to reassure the older blind man that she was alive and so was he.</p>

        <p>A sigh had escaped hsi lips, before he responded, "Thank the six that you are alive! It makes me happy knowing that another one of us lives. However, I am in need of your medical attention.... Please, can you take me to the caravan?"</p>

        <p>"Of course, daddy," Dahlia responded quietly before gently pulling up her father into a standing position, using her body as a crutch to assist the injured man to the caravan to be healed.</p>
